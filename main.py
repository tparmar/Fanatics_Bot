    "Never forget: West Brom 5-2 Chelsea", "As long as you don't wear baggy pants and tighty whities at the same time, you'll be fine in life. Just ask Ishan!", 
    "Chapathis, jigglying in my belly! - Ishan Mungikar", 
    "Fun Fact: Ishan and Goaters had a phase called Style, where they would pull up the pants where high, and tuck in their shirt. They looked those basketball players from the 1980s.", 
    "Fun Fact: Once, Goaters had a tap in on the goal line but defied physics and hit the crossbar.", 
    "Nipun in rocket league: NippinDots has left the party. NippinDots lost connection", 
    "Fun Fact: One time at a party at Nipun's house, Ishan sat on Nihaal's head and gave him another concussion right after Nihaal healed from his last one. Smart right?", 
    "Fun Fact: In eigth grade, Nihaal broke one of his arms. The day he got his brace off, he broke his other arm. Talk about stupid.",

    "Want some salt? Ask Ishan about Sid's cherry-picking :laughing:",
    "That time Alisson scored against West Brom in the 95th minute :laughing:",
    "Fun Fact: One time, Sid tried to get fancy on an open goal and tried to roulette it in, but missed the ball. Shourya took it forward, passed to Kuhsh, who crossed it in for Arjuna (who was on the other team) who volleyed it into his own net. What a play! :rofl:",
    "Remember that time Arsenal finished in the top 4? Me neither.",
    "Ask Liverpool fans where their center backs are. They won't be able to tell you anything.",
    "What's more empty, Manchester city's fanbase or Tottenham's trophy cabinet?",
    "Tottenham Fans vs Arsenal Fans ----- Totenham fans: \'Arsenal haven't finished top 4 in like forever, they are not even in Europe next season, and you guys have such bad players. I mean look at your table position!\' Arsenal Fans: \'We won the FA cup, so we are better\'"

  story = "It was March 8, 2017, and the weather was beautiful. Everyone felt it. The vibe. Although Barca were down 4-0 against PSG, there was just a feeling that Barca was still in it. As Sriboy once said: I smell a comeback! The game had an impressive attendance of 96,290 despite the home side's heavy defeat in the first game. Barcelona's Luis Suárez scored the first goal of the game in the 3rd minute after heading the ball over the line before it was cleared by Thomas Meunier. In the 40th minute, Paris Saint-Germain's Layvin Kurzawa scored an own goal in an attempt to block a shot by Andrés Iniesta. The third goal came in the 50th minute via a penalty scored by Lionel Messi after Neymar was fouled by Thomas Meunier. Barcelona's hopes were seemingly brought down after Edinson Cavani scored Paris Saint-Germain's only goal in the 62nd minute, leaving them requiring three more to win due to the away goals rule now favouring PSG. Neymar scored two goals in the closing stages – a free kick in the 88th minute and a penalty kick in the 91st – to make it 5–1. In the final seconds of the match, Neymar delivered a cross into the penalty area, and Sergi Roberto scored their sixth and final goal in the 95th minute thus winning the game 6–1 and advancing to the quarter finals 6–5 on aggregate. WHAT A GAME I SAY, WHAT A GAME. Also, I miss Suarez. That guy had huge teeth."
